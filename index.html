		<h1>What is the Eight Poles Marathon?</h1>
		<p>The Eight Poles Marathon is a race for 1-n participants that starts and ends next to the Western Pole of <a href="http://mcau.org">the MCAU Minecraft server</a>. In order to complete the race, participants must reach each of the eight Poles of the map (one at each corner and one in the centre of each side of the map) and return to the start. This must be done without performing any form of teleportation.</p>
	</article>
	<article>
		<h1>What do I need to participate?</h1>
		<p>Participants in the Eight Poles Marathon need to have access to <a href="http://mcau.org">the MCAU Minecraft server</a>. Participants should also bring an ample supply of food and a boat. Participants who are not donors to the server or who are not using god mode should also have a good set of armor and weapons as the terrain and mobs can be quite treacherous. Participants should also consider bringing a bed to jump in and out of to avoid run-ins with <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Phantom">Minecraft 1.13's new Phantoms</a>.</p>
	</article>
	<article>
		<h1>How long does it take?</h1>
		<p>The Eight Poles Marathon is an, at minimum, 32 kilometre event, with several detours to avoid unworkable terrain. At walking pace, it could take anywhere between 3 and 4 hours. As participants grow more comfortable with the course, they may consider running through it, which will lower the time by some amount. As elytra and fireworks become more accessible, especially fast runs could become viable. Ignoring these factors, participants should expect to spend a few hours on the race.</p>
